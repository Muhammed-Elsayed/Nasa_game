# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



# Earth Systems Interconnectedness Game

## Project Overview
This project is an interactive web-based game designed to educate users about the interconnectedness of Earth’s systems—such as the atmosphere, oceans, forests, and more. Players control factors like factory emissions and plastic consumption to see real-time effects on these systems. Additionally, the game features an AI model that predicts the likelihood of wildfires based on user inputs.

## Features
- **Interactive Earth Systems:** Players can manipulate variables like pollution, deforestation, and plastic consumption to see their effects on the environment.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** The game visually demonstrates the immediate consequences of environmental choices on different systems like oceans, atmosphere, and forests.
- **AI-Driven Insights:** An AI model predicts wildfire risks based on inputs such as temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
- **Educational Value:** Encourages climate awareness and understanding of how small changes can impact the broader ecosystem.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **AI Model:** Python
- **Data Sources:** NASA’s environmental data

## How to Play
1. **Adjust Inputs:** Use the game controls to manipulate variables like factory emissions, plastic usage, and other environmental factors.
2. **Observe Changes:** Watch how your inputs affect the Earth’s systems in real time.
3. **AI Model:** Input factors into the AI model and see predictions on the likelihood of wildfires.
4. **Learn and Reflect:** Understand the consequences of your choices and learn how different systems interact with each other.
